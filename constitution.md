The people have the freedom to remain completely secure, not only from forces outside of their control, but from outside of the confines of our borders, as well threats within. This complete security is extended to them through the possession of any armament one would use to defend themselves. We know that the people would feel forfeited of this right if another arms themselves against them in a manor that would diminish the power of this freedom in their eyes. For this reason, it will be the state's duty keeps such armaments in the hands of those skilled enough to use them. This article enforces the following duties upon the state, and provides the following services to the people.
-{a} The establishment of a nationally standardized, state operated weapons registration system for firearms and armaments.

## Article 2: Freedom of Universal Speech
The people should have the ability to speak of the injustices of the state, of the people, (or) of circumstance at any time without fear of retaliation or censorship. In the manor of speech the people have the power or scope to act as they please, unless broadcast in those unwilling to the voice of reason. To protect the people's liberty from each others right to universal speech, restrictions have to apply. In this regard, private institutions, and centers of education have the right to restrict speech from within their scope. The people are asked to respect their freedoms. This freedom extends to include, and respects, the press in all cases in which the press does not infringe upon other person's freedoms. The press is encouraged to catalog both the greatest of the people's accomplishments, and the horrors that the people suffer at the hands of others or forces outside of our control. However, in light of the freedoms that this article represents; no cunt will fuck the people's right to free speech. This article enforces the following duties upon the state, and provides the following services to the people.

These networks will be separate from the state serving the people, at the discretion of the people's consent. Communication in this medium will be established by the people.

Investigation into injustices will be taken seriously by the state in order to preserve its national security.

## Article 3: Freedom of Information Acquisition
The people have the freedom to access information at their own will, in relation to any subject they seek, without fear of intervention by the government. Unfortunately, there will be those who use this information freedom as a means to bring harm upon others or themselves. This cannot be avoided, so the state will make no attempts to prevent it, in the hopes that other, informed citizens, may take action against them. Because of the nature of the transparency our government will attempt to take, sensitive information will need to be restricted from the public eye in respect of national security. There are many examples of situations that would incur of this. Therefore, we hope the public will respect the government's decision to value secrecy more than information freedom in such sensitive circumstances. Trust that the government will, in due time, shed light of this information in a manner both public, (and) obvious. This article enforces the following duties upon the state, and provides the following services to the people.
-{a} The establishment of a state operated network of research and development materials, under direct control of the people.

The people may assemble in any public place for any reason, even in numbers insurmountable, in order to bring to light issues that are in their eyes, and of the people at large, to be unjust; against any private institution, public service, or against the state or government itself. This freedom represents the democratic power of the people, even should democratic freedom not be recognized by the state. When the people arise, a revolution in the thoughts of, and actions of, a civilization also take place. Interference of this kind can spark fear in the people, and for this reason, the people's government have taken the responsibility to ensure their security. Ironically, when the people are rising fist against the government, who is trying to protect the people by deterring the fist of revolution; the government can appear oppressive. This is not just, so measures must be taken in order to deter the complications and facsimiles to these revolutionary ideologies. This article enforces the following duties upon the state, and provides the following services to the people.
-{a} The establishment of a law enforcement agency, as a sub organization of the people's army, in order to protect citizens in their day to day lives, and to mediate the force of people when the fist of revolution arises. This law enforcement is no control, direct, or indirect by the government as a whole, but instead the state's judges, and its judicial branch the House of Judges.
-{b} An organized, delivered, (and) controlled method; with ease of use, for any citizen to occupy a public space, without fear of retaliation by local enforcement of law.
